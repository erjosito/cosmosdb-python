    "As you probably know, [Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/) is a globally distributed, multi-model database service in Azure that supports document, key-value, wide-column, and graph databases.\n",

    "Cosmos DB includes support for multiple Software Development Kits for programming languages such as Python. Multiple resources already exist that help to learn to use the Python SDK: \n",

    "* [Cosmos DB samples with the Python SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cosmos-python/blob/master/test/crud_tests.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "As opposed to documentation or code samples, Jupyter Notebooks offer a very interesting combination of rich text for explanations and pieces of code that can be executed independently from each other, which makes it ideal to learn a new technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will go over the basic (and not so basic) concepts of using Cosmos DB with its Python SDK for the SQL API. You can run this repository from any system with Python 3.x, or using the free platform [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/), where you have the option of importing Github repositories."
